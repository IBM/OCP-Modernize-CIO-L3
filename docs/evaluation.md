# Evaluation Criteria for IBM Technical Sellers and Business Partners
---

The series of hands-on tutorials and learning modules embedded in this Level 3 course are designed to provide IBM Technical Sellers and Business Partners with the fluency to gain trusted advisor status with clients and the expertise to tailor live technological demonstrations for customers.

The hands-on lab will examine a day in the life of Amy, a Chief Innovation Officer (CIO), and her team as they embark on a digital transformation of *Stacked Corporation*'s business. Their work and expertise encompass everything from application developers, to IT administrators, to data scientists. As such, DevOps and IT Ops will be a heavy focus of this course— with security, observability, and automation topics to follow in future hands-on learning.

Through the lens of a Chief Innovation Officer, you will:

- **Module A**: Enable continuous deployment via Red Hat OpenShift S2I (Source-2-Image) and GitHub webhooks

- **Module B**: *Graphically* (using the OpenShift web dashboard) create, scale, upgrade, and rollback an application with Red Hat OpenShift

- **Module C**: *Programmatically* (using a built-in command line interface) create, scale, upgrade, and rollback an application with Red Hat OpenShift

Each module of this course and hands-on lab work should take an estimated 60 minutes to complete (or less depending on your technical expediency). In total, the lab work should take you **no more than 5 hours**.

To receive a Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements— and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation —differs depending on job role.

!!! note "IBM TECHNICAL SELLERS"
        
        IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a **Stand & Deliver** presentation, which will be uploaded to the IBM Stand & Deliver platform for evaluation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera.
        
        IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to. The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab.

!!! tip "BUSINESS PARTNERS"

        Business Partners must pass an **accreditation quiz** after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question.

        The quiz questions will ask you about on-screen text or descriptions that come up as you work through the lab guide. Answers to quiz questions can only be determined by carefully following the instructions of the hands-on lab. Sections of the lab marked as `OPTIONAL` will **not** be tested on as part of the quiz. You will have three attempts in total to obtain a passing grade.

1. Seller articulated client's pain point(s) and the value proposition of using OpenShift on IBM Power Systems.

2. Seller highlighted use cases for OpenShift on Power.

3. Seller demonstrated and discussed several of the key differentiated capabilities of OpenShift on Power that deliver on the value proposition on point one.

4. Seller highlighted benefits to the client (this is the why the client can’t live without these benefits section).
