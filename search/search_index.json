Additional ways to watch: Seismic replay available for download. Chief Innovation Officer \u2014 A Day in the Life Amy , the Chief Innovation Officer (CIO) for Stacked Corp. , has a formidable task before her: overseeing a rapid and seamless modernization effort of the company\u2019s legacy application and services stack, as part of Stacked\u2019s digital transformation strategy. Amy\u2019s team encompasses a range of disciplines, areas of specialization, and scope of responsibilities. It includes: developers and programmers, building out the next generation of applications while also maintaining legacy code; IT administrators, tasked with migrating the business into a new hybrid multicloud environment running on IBM Power Systems; as well as data scientists and other subject matter experts, who require uninterrupted access to the company\u2019s services and data while this modernization effort is underway. This is a company in the early days of their digital modernization efforts. How did they get here and where will they go next? The modernization initiative that the CIO\u2019s office has helmed didn\u2019t emerge from a vacuum. Stacked Corporation\u2019s strategy mirrors the experience of nearly every client (in nearly every industry) that you\u2019ll speak with today: they are either spending money to save money or spending money to make money. Economics are a hugely compelling force behind why every enterprise is looking to digitally modernize today (although certainly not the only reason.) When you spend it to save it, you\u2019re renovating; and when you spend it to make it, you\u2019re innovating. The best strategies will do both and leverage cost savings from renovating the IT landscape (spending money to save it) to partially fund the innovation (spending money to make it). To illustrate this model, we\u2019ll use something we call a Data Acumen Curve . Note the emergence of a natural border between renovating and innovating. Every client needs to be able to derive downstream benefits of a renovation project, in order to justify the modernization efforts. This simple framework is handy for any strategic investment decisions a company will face across almost any domain.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"#chief-innovation-officer-a-day-in-the-life","text":"Amy , the Chief Innovation Officer (CIO) for Stacked Corp. , has a formidable task before her: overseeing a rapid and seamless modernization effort of the company\u2019s legacy application and services stack, as part of Stacked\u2019s digital transformation strategy.
